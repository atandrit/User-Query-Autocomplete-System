# User Query Autocomplete System

The goal of this project is to develop a simple C++ program that can store a list of words from a dictionary file using a trie data structure. Once the words are loaded into the trie, the program can use it to provide an auto-complete functionality, suggesting a list of possible completions for a given query prefix.

The program will prompt the user to enter a prefix, and it will use the trie to search for all words that match the prefix. The program will then print the matching words to the screen, allowing the user to select one of the options or continue typing the prefix to refine the search.

## Documentation


The program has two main functionalities: loading words from a file into a trie, and auto-completing query prefixes. The trie data structure is used to store the words in a way that makes searching for prefixes efficient.

To use the program, follow these steps:

1. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
2. Run the executable file.
3. Enter a prefix to auto-complete. The program will search the  trie for words that match the prefix and display them on the screen.
4. If the list of matching words is too long, refine the prefix to narrow down the search. If the list is too short, add more characters to the prefix to expand the search.
